<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alec i am 5 foot 10 inches tall,i never knew how computers worked until my fiancee that i love and adore so dearly showed me this web development course.I have learned so much from this course that i want to persue a career with it, with that being said
  Web development has become a passion to me, a passion i did not have for computers or any thing with IT. </p>

<P>My passion and my dream is boxing and becoming a welter weight champion of the world although, money is a problem when you have a tight budget to get through a month.
  But through hard work,dedication and faith you can achieve anything you put your mind to,with that being said im learning my self around a computer so that i can make a better living for me and my family and have some time to meet up with thee old punching bag.

</p>

<p>So that explains me my life and my dream in a short summary.</p>
