then Starsky and Hutch is a movie that you need to watch.
Starring two time global award winning, Ben stiller as David starsky.

that they won't stop at nothing to get the job done.With gun slinging action and
with fun comdey laughter as Owen Wilson makes fun off Ben Stiller.

Starring one of the truly best actors to ever acted, Adam Sandler with funny
jokes and pranks being pulled on each other ,Adam Sandler always brings the family togther.
